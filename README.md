# Malcious_QR-Code
This Flask app generates a QR code that links to a page which shows browser-exposed, non-sensitive device information (user-agent, screen size, approximate memory/cores, connection type, etc.). The page will only send data to the server if the visitor clicks Share &amp; Show (explicit consent).
